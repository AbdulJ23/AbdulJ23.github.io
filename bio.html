            My name is Abdul and I have an interest  in technology, health sciences, and business .
When I first graduated highschool I went on to attend the Ohio State University for a major in biology with a track on pre-med. I wanted to go into medicine because a lot of people in my family had a passion for it, and I also loved to help people. However, while I was in school I was not enjoying the courses and I started to reconsider what I wanted to pursue. I reflected on my childhood and realized I always loved technology. As a kid I would always mess around with the computers in the house. I also developed a love for video games when my father bought me my first gaming console which was a playstation 2. After some self reflection I decided I wanted to pursue programming, but I didn't want to go through the college route as I felt I had already spent too much time and too much money on university . I started researching what's the best way I can learn programming and get my foot into the world of software development without going through the university route. As I researched I heard news about intensive coding bootcamps which give you hands on learning . I then looked for some in my area and found We Can Code IT.  A top rated bootcamp with professional career services that help you get started in software development. I went through their website and read up on the past students and I decided to enroll!
